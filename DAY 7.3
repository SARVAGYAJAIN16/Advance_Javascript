  BigInt

  BigInt: BigInt in JavaScript is a data type used to represent and perform operations on large integers that exceed the limits of regular numbers.

  Creating BigInts:
 - Using the `n` suffix:

 Using the BigInt() constructor:
 const anotherLargeNumber = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
 console.log(anotherLargeNumber);

  Nullish Coalescing Operator 

 In JavaScript, the nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that provides a concise way to handle nullish (null or undefined) values. 
 It returns its right-hand operand when its left-hand operand is null or undefined, otherwise, it returns the left-hand operand.

 let favNum = 0; // falsy
 userFavNum = favNum || 10;

  Optional Chaining Operator 
   It provides a concise way to access properties of an object without worrying about the existence of intermediate properties.
   It's particularly useful when working with nested objects or accessing properties of objects that may be null or undefined.

// const person = {
//   name: "John",
//   address: {
//     city: 0,
//     zipCode: 12345,
//   },
// };
